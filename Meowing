    <h2><strong>Definition</strong></h2>
    <p>A Meowing Competition was first held in 2014 when Mike the Raccoon and Ella the Cat first decided they will be together. 
        The rule is to use as many meows as possible to replace daily used words. When the relationship was further developed, the 
        competition keeps advancing. Abstract concepts and more complex emotions are conveyed in a wider range of meows.<p>
